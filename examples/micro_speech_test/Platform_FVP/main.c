 * Semihosting is a mechanism that enables code running on an ARM target
 * to communicate and use the Input/Output facilities of a host computer
 * that is running a debugger.
 * There is an issue where if you use armclang at -O0 optimisation with
 * no parameters specified in the main function, the initialisation code
 * contains a breakpoint for semihosting by default. This will stop the * code from running before main is reached.
 * Semihosting can be disabled by defining __ARM_use_no_argv symbol
 * (or using higher optimization level).
