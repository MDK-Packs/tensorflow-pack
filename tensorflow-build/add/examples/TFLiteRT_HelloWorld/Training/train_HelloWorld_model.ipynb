        "## Introduction to the Jupyter Notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "This Jupyter Notebook is inspired by the **Hello World Example** from the official LiteRT documentation for microcontrollers, which demonstrates how to train and deploy a model to predict the sine of a given input value [LiteRT Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert/microcontrollers/get_started). The models trained here will be deployed directly to the model layer of this project.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Project Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The complete project is a hardware-agnostic [CMSIS Reference Application](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/blob/main/docs/ReferenceApplications.md), designed to be compatible with any target hardware that supports the STDIO feature. This flexibility allows users to adapt the application to various devices without significant modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Deep Learning and Sine Function Modeling\n",
        "\n",
        "Deep learning networks are powerful tools for modeling patterns in data. In this notebook, we focus on training a network to model data generated by a **sine function**. The goal is to create a model that can take an input value `x` and predict its sine, `y`. This process involves training the model using a dataset of sine values and then deploying it for inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Training Process\n",
        "\n",
        "The training process for the official model is outlined in the **`train.py`** script, which is part of the TensorFlow Lite Micro examples. This notebook picks up parts of it to train two models in a step by step approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Notebook Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook will guide you through the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Generation**: Creating a dataset of sine values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Model Training**: Training a neural network to predict sine values.\n",

        "**Model Deployment**: Deploying the trained model to the project's model layer.\n",
        "\n",
